## ðŸ“¸ Next Steps (For You)

### 1. Add Rendered Images
**Priority renders to create:**
1. **Hero image** (`docs/hero_render.png`)
   - Your best, most impressive scene
   - 1920x1080 or higher
   - Multiple materials visible
   - Good composition and lighting

2. **Editor screenshot** (`docs/editor_screenshot.png`)
   - Show the ImGui interface in action
   - 3D viewport with objects
   - UI panels visible

3. **Material showcase** (`docs/materials_showcase.png`)
   - 5 spheres showing: diffuse, metal, glass, emissive, mirror
   - Side-by-side comparison

**Recommended scene for hero shot:**
```bash
# In the editor:
- 3-5 spheres with different materials
- One emissive sphere as light source
- Metal floor (mirror material)
- Camera angle: slightly above, 45Â° angle
- Render settings: 500+ samples, 1080p+
```

### 2. Test Build on Clean System (Optional)
```bash
# Clone your repo fresh
git clone https://github.com/Alex-Amedro/Rayt.git
cd Rayt/c++
make editor
./editor
```

### 3. Update README Image Links
Once you have images, uncomment these lines in README.md:
```markdown
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/hero_render.png" alt="Ray Traced Scene" width="800"/>
</p>
```

And add more in the Gallery section.

## ðŸ’¼ Using This for Internship Applications

### In Your CV
```
Ray Tracer with Interactive 3D Editor (C++17, OpenGL)
- Implemented physically-based path tracing with global illumination
- Built real-time OpenGL editor with ImGui interface
- Optimized with multi-threading (6-7x speedup on 8 cores)
- 3,500+ lines of clean, modular C++
â†’ GitHub: github.com/Alex-Amedro/Rayt
```

### In Cover Letters
